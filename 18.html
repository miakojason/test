                        I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
                        Yeah
                        To take a stand (to take a stand)
                        It's been a ride
                        Everybody (everybody)
                        I guess I had to go to that place
                        Come take my hand (come take my hand)
                        To get to this one
                        We'll walk this road together, through the storm
                        Now some of you might still be in that place
                        Whatever weather, cold or warm
                        If you're tryna get out (just lettin' you know that you're not alone)
                        Just follow me (holla if you feel like you've been down the same road)
                        I'll get you there
                        You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
                        But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em

                        The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
                        Not a footprint to be seen
                        A kingdom of isolation
                        And it looks like I'm the queen
                        The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
                        Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried
                        Don't let them in, don't let them see
                        Be the good girl you always have to be
                        Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
                        Well, now they know
                        Let it go, let it go
                        Can't hold it back anymore
                        Let it go, let it go
                        Turn away and slam the door
                        I don't care what they're going to say
                        Let the storm rage on

                        Said, "There's another" (yo), and looked right in my eyes (uh-huh)

                        Like, "Baby, baby, baby, no"
